\chapter{Building applications}
\hypertarget{build_guide}{}\label{build_guide}\index{Building applications@{Building applications}}
This is about compiling and linking applications that use GLFW. For information on how to write such applications, start with the \doxysectlink{quick_guide}{introductory tutorial}{0}. For information on how to compile the GLFW library itself, see \doxysectlink{compile_guide}{Compiling GLFW}{0}.

This is not a tutorial on compilation or linking. It assumes basic understanding of how to compile and link a C program as well as how to use the specific compiler of your chosen development environment. The compilation and linking process should be explained in your C programming material and in the documentation for your development environment.\hypertarget{build_guide_build_include}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Including the GLFW header file}{Including the GLFW header file}}\label{build_guide_build_include}
You should include the GLFW header in the source files where you use Open\+GL or GLFW.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include\ <GLFW/glfw3.h>}}

\end{DoxyCode}


This header defines all the constants and declares all the types and function prototypes of the GLFW API. By default it also includes the Open\+GL header from your development environment. See \doxysectlink{build_guide_build_macros}{option macros}{2} below for how to select Open\+GL ES headers and more.

The GLFW header also defines any platform-\/specific macros needed by your Open\+GL header, so that it can be included without needing any window system headers.

It does this only when needed, so if window system headers are included, the GLFW header does not try to redefine those symbols. The reverse is not true, i.\+e. {\ttfamily windows.\+h} cannot cope if any Win32 symbols have already been defined.

In other words\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use the GLFW header to include Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES headers portably
\item Do not include window system headers unless you will use those APIs directly
\item If you do need such headers, include them before the GLFW header
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you are using an Open\+GL extension loading library such as \href{https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad}{\texttt{ glad}}, the extension loader header should be included before the GLFW one. GLFW attempts to detect any Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES header or extension loader header included before it and will then disable the inclusion of the default Open\+GL header. Most extension loaders also define macros that disable similar headers below it.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include\ <\mbox{\hyperlink{gl_8h}{glad/gl.h}}>}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include\ <GLFW/glfw3.h>}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Both of these mechanisms depend on the extension loader header defining a known macro. If yours doesn\textquotesingle{}t or you don\textquotesingle{}t know which one your users will pick, the \doxylink{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE}{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+NONE} macro will explicitly prevent the GLFW header from including the Open\+GL header. This will also allow you to include the two headers in any order.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#define\ GLFW\_INCLUDE\_NONE}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include\ <GLFW/glfw3.h>}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include\ <\mbox{\hyperlink{gl_8h}{glad/gl.h}}>}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{build_guide_build_macros}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{GLFW header option macros}{GLFW header option macros}}\label{build_guide_build_macros}
These macros may be defined before the inclusion of the GLFW header and affect its behavior.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_DLL}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_DLL}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+DLL}} is required on Windows when using the GLFW DLL, to tell the compiler that the GLFW functions are defined in a DLL.

The following macros control which Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES API header is included. Only one of these may be defined at a time.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
GLFW does not provide any of the API headers mentioned below. They are provided by your development environment or your Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES or Vulkan SDK, and most of them can be downloaded from the \href{https://www.khronos.org/registry/}{\texttt{ Khronos Registry}}.
\end{DoxyNote}
\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_GLCOREARB}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_GLCOREARB}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+GLCOREARB}} makes the GLFW header include the modern {\ttfamily GL/glcorearb.\+h} header ({\ttfamily Open\+GL/gl3.\+h} on mac\+OS) instead of the regular Open\+GL header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES1}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES1}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+ES1}} makes the GLFW header include the Open\+GL ES 1.\+x {\ttfamily GLES/gl.\+h} header instead of the regular Open\+GL header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES2}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES2}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+ES2}} makes the GLFW header include the Open\+GL ES 2.\+0 {\ttfamily GLES2/gl2.\+h} header instead of the regular Open\+GL header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES3}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES3}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+ES3}} makes the GLFW header include the Open\+GL ES 3.\+0 {\ttfamily GLES3/gl3.\+h} header instead of the regular Open\+GL header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES31}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES31}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+ES31}} makes the GLFW header include the Open\+GL ES 3.\+1 {\ttfamily GLES3/gl31.\+h} header instead of the regular Open\+GL header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES32}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_ES32}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+ES32}} makes the GLFW header include the Open\+GL ES 3.\+2 {\ttfamily GLES3/gl32.\+h} header instead of the regular Open\+GL header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+NONE}} makes the GLFW header not include any Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES API header. This is useful in combination with an extension loading library.

If none of the above inclusion macros are defined, the standard Open\+GL {\ttfamily GL/gl.\+h} header ({\ttfamily Open\+GL/gl.\+h} on mac\+OS) is included, unless GLFW detects the inclusion guards of any Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES or extension loader header it knows about.

The following macros control the inclusion of additional API headers. Any number of these may be defined simultaneously, and/or together with one of the above macros.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_VULKAN}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+VULKAN}} makes the GLFW header include the Vulkan {\ttfamily vulkan/vulkan.\+h} header in addition to any selected Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_GLEXT}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_GLEXT}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+GLEXT}} makes the GLFW header include the appropriate extension header for the Open\+GL or Open\+GL ES header selected above after and in addition to that header.

\label{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_GLU}%
\Hypertarget{build_guide_GLFW_INCLUDE_GLU}%
{\bfseries{GLFW\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+GLU}} makes the header include the GLU header in addition to the header selected above. This should only be used with the standard Open\+GL header and only for compatibility with legacy code. GLU has been deprecated and should not be used in new code.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
None of these macros may be defined during the compilation of GLFW itself. If your build includes GLFW and you define any these in your build files, make sure they are not applied to the GLFW sources.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{build_guide_build_link}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Link with the right libraries}{Link with the right libraries}}\label{build_guide_build_link}
GLFW is essentially a wrapper of various platform-\/specific APIs and therefore needs to link against many different system libraries. If you are using GLFW as a shared library / dynamic library / DLL then it takes care of these links. However, if you are using GLFW as a static library then your executable will need to link against these libraries.

On Windows and mac\+OS, the list of system libraries is static and can be hard-\/coded into your build environment. See the section for your development environment below. On Linux and other Unix-\/like operating systems, the list varies but can be retrieved in various ways as described below.

A good general introduction to linking is \href{https://www.lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html}{\texttt{ Beginner\textquotesingle{}s Guide to Linkers}} by David Drysdale.\hypertarget{build_guide_build_link_win32}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{With Min\+GW or Visual C++ on Windows}{With MinGW or Visual C++ on Windows}}\label{build_guide_build_link_win32}
The static version of the GLFW library is named {\ttfamily glfw3}. When using this version, it is also necessary to link with some libraries that GLFW uses.

When using Min\+GW to link an application with the static version of GLFW, you must also explicitly link with {\ttfamily gdi32}. Other toolchains including Min\+GW-\/w64 include it in the set of default libraries along with other dependencies like {\ttfamily user32} and {\ttfamily kernel32}.

The link library for the GLFW DLL is named {\ttfamily glfw3dll}. When compiling an application that uses the DLL version of GLFW, you need to define the \doxylink{build_guide_GLFW_DLL}{GLFW\+\_\+\+DLL} macro {\itshape before} any inclusion of the GLFW header. This can be done either with a compiler switch or by defining it in your source code.\hypertarget{build_guide_build_link_cmake_source}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{With CMake and GLFW source}{With CMake and GLFW source}}\label{build_guide_build_link_cmake_source}
This section is about using CMake to compile and link GLFW along with your application. If you want to use an installed binary instead, see \doxysectlink{build_guide_build_link_cmake_package}{With CMake and installed GLFW binaries}{2}.

With a few changes to your {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} you can have the GLFW source tree built along with your application.

When including GLFW as part of your build, you probably don\textquotesingle{}t want to build the GLFW tests, examples and documentation. To disable these, set the corresponding cache variables before adding the GLFW source tree.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{set(GLFW\_BUILD\_DOCS\ OFF\ CACHE\ BOOL\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}"{}}\ FORCE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{set(GLFW\_BUILD\_TESTS\ OFF\ CACHE\ BOOL\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}"{}}\ FORCE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{set(GLFW\_BUILD\_EXAMPLES\ OFF\ CACHE\ BOOL\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}"{}}\ FORCE)}

\end{DoxyCode}


Add the root directory of the GLFW source tree to your project. This will add the {\ttfamily glfw} target to your project.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_subdirectory(path/to/glfw)}

\end{DoxyCode}


Once GLFW has been added, link your application against the {\ttfamily glfw} target. This adds the GLFW library and its link-\/time dependencies as it is currently configured, the include directory for the GLFW header and, when applicable, the \doxylink{build_guide_GLFW_DLL}{GLFW\+\_\+\+DLL} macro.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(myapp\ glfw)}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the {\ttfamily glfw} target does not depend on Open\+GL, as GLFW loads any Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES or Vulkan libraries it needs at runtime. If your application calls Open\+GL directly, instead of using a modern \doxysectlink{context_guide_context_glext_auto}{extension loader library}{2}, use the Open\+GL CMake package.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package(OpenGL\ REQUIRED)}

\end{DoxyCode}


If Open\+GL is found, the {\ttfamily Open\+GL\+::\+GL} target is added to your project, containing library and include directory paths. Link against this like any other library.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(myapp\ OpenGL::GL)}

\end{DoxyCode}


For a minimal example of a program and GLFW sources built with CMake, see the \href{https://github.com/juliettef/GLFW-CMake-starter}{\texttt{ GLFW CMake Starter}} on Git\+Hub.\hypertarget{build_guide_build_link_cmake_package}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{With CMake and installed GLFW binaries}{With CMake and installed GLFW binaries}}\label{build_guide_build_link_cmake_package}
This section is about using CMake to link GLFW after it has been built and installed. If you want to build it along with your application instead, see \doxysectlink{build_guide_build_link_cmake_source}{With CMake and GLFW source}{2}.

With a few changes to your {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} you can locate the package and target files generated when GLFW is installed.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package(glfw3\ 3.3\ REQUIRED)}

\end{DoxyCode}


Once GLFW has been added to the project, link against it with the {\ttfamily glfw} target. This adds the GLFW library and its link-\/time dependencies, the include directory for the GLFW header and, when applicable, the \doxylink{build_guide_GLFW_DLL}{GLFW\+\_\+\+DLL} macro.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(myapp\ glfw)}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the {\ttfamily glfw} target does not depend on Open\+GL, as GLFW loads any Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES or Vulkan libraries it needs at runtime. If your application calls Open\+GL directly, instead of using a modern \doxysectlink{context_guide_context_glext_auto}{extension loader library}{2}, use the Open\+GL CMake package.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{find\_package(OpenGL\ REQUIRED)}

\end{DoxyCode}


If Open\+GL is found, the {\ttfamily Open\+GL\+::\+GL} target is added to your project, containing library and include directory paths. Link against this like any other library.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(myapp\ OpenGL::GL)}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{build_guide_build_link_pkgconfig}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{With makefiles and pkg-\/config on Unix}{With makefiles and pkg-config on Unix}}\label{build_guide_build_link_pkgconfig}
GLFW supports \href{https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/}{\texttt{ pkg-\/config}}, and the {\ttfamily glfw3.\+pc} pkg-\/config file is generated when the GLFW library is built and is installed along with it. A pkg-\/config file describes all necessary compile-\/time and link-\/time flags and dependencies needed to use a library. When they are updated or if they differ between systems, you will get the correct ones automatically.

A typical compile and link command-\/line when using the static version of the GLFW library may look like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cc\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/cflags\ glfw3)\ -\/o\ myprog\ myprog.c\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/static\ -\/-\/libs\ glfw3)}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you are using the shared version of the GLFW library, omit the {\ttfamily -\/-\/static} flag.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cc\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/cflags\ glfw3)\ -\/o\ myprog\ myprog.c\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/libs\ glfw3)}

\end{DoxyCode}


You can also use the {\ttfamily glfw3.\+pc} file without installing it first, by using the {\ttfamily PKG\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+PATH} environment variable.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{env\ PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH=path/to/glfw/src\ cc\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/cflags\ glfw3)\ -\/o\ myprog\ myprog.c\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/libs\ glfw3)}

\end{DoxyCode}


The dependencies do not include Open\+GL, as GLFW loads any Open\+GL, Open\+GL ES or Vulkan libraries it needs at runtime. If your application calls Open\+GL directly, instead of using a modern \doxysectlink{context_guide_context_glext_auto}{extension loader library}{2}, you should add the {\ttfamily gl} pkg-\/config package.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cc\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/cflags\ glfw3\ gl)\ -\/o\ myprog\ myprog.c\ \$(pkg-\/config\ -\/-\/libs\ glfw3\ gl)}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{build_guide_build_link_xcode}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{With Xcode on mac\+OS}{With Xcode on macOS}}\label{build_guide_build_link_xcode}
If you are using the dynamic library version of GLFW, add it to the project dependencies.

If you are using the static library version of GLFW, add it and the Cocoa, Open\+GL and IOKit frameworks to the project as dependencies. They can all be found in {\ttfamily /\+System/\+Library/\+Frameworks}.\hypertarget{build_guide_build_link_osx}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{With command-\/line on mac\+OS}{With command-line on macOS}}\label{build_guide_build_link_osx}
It is recommended that you use \doxysectlink{build_guide_build_link_pkgconfig}{pkg-\/config}{2} when building from the command line on mac\+OS. That way you will get any new dependencies added automatically. If you still wish to build manually, you need to add the required frameworks and libraries to your command-\/line yourself using the {\ttfamily -\/l} and {\ttfamily -\/framework} switches.

If you are using the dynamic GLFW library, which is named {\ttfamily libglfw.\+3.\+dylib}, do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cc\ -\/o\ myprog\ myprog.c\ -\/lglfw\ -\/framework\ Cocoa\ -\/framework\ OpenGL\ -\/framework\ IOKit}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you are using the static library, named {\ttfamily libglfw3.\+a}, substitute {\ttfamily -\/lglfw3} for {\ttfamily -\/lglfw}.

Note that you do not add the {\ttfamily .framework} extension to a framework when linking against it from the command-\/line.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Your machine may have {\ttfamily lib\+GL.\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.dylib} style Open\+GL library, but that is for the X Window System and will not work with the mac\+OS native version of GLFW. 
\end{DoxyNote}
