# Analogue Circuit Simulator

## Introduction

The Analogue Circuit Simulator is a robust tool designed for simulating and analyzing various analog electronic circuits. Developed as part of a coursework assignment for the Software Engineering Design and Development (SED500) course, this project showcases a practical application of theoretical concepts in electronic circuit design and simulation.

## Features

- **Circuit Design**: Intuitive interface for creating and modifying circuit designs.
- **Simulation Engine**: Accurate simulation of analog circuit behavior including DC, AC analyses.
- **Component Library**: Wide range of electronic components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, and more.
- **Analysis Tools**: Tools for measuring voltage, current, frequency response, and other important parameters.

## Installation

To get started with the Analogue Circuit Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fahad-Ali-Khan-ca/Analogue-Circuit-Simulator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Analogue-Circuit-Simulator
```

3. The Graphics
The graphics library used for this assignment is OpenGL. The following link explains how to add OpenGL to Visual Studio:
